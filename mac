Upgrading from MySQL <8.4 to MySQL >9.0 requires running MySQL 8.4 first:
 - brew services stop mysql
 - brew install mysql@8.4
 - brew services start mysql@8.4
 - brew services stop mysql@8.4
 - brew services start mysql

We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:
    mysql_secure_installation

MySQL is configured to only allow connections from localhost by default

To connect run:
    mysql -u root

To restart mysql after an upgrade:
  brew services restart mysql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir\=/opt/homebrew/var/mysql
